Description: statebins is an alternative to choropleth maps for US States and
    is based on work by the Washington Post graphics department in their report
    on "The states most threatened by trade". statebins preserves as much of
    the geographic placment of the states as possible but has the look and
    feel of a traditional heatmap. Functions are provided that allow for use
    of both a binned, discrete scale and continuous scale depending on what
    is needed for the underlying data.
