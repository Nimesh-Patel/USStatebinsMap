Title: statebins - U.S. State Cartogram Heatmaps in R; an alternative to
    choropleth maps for USA States
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2015-01-30
Author: Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr)

Description: statebins is an alternative to choropleth maps for USA States and
    is based on work by the Washington Post graphics department in their report
    on "The states most threatened by trade". statebins preserves as much of
    the geographic placement of the states as possible but has the look and
    feel of a traditional heatmap. Functions are provided that allow for use
    of a binned, discrete scale, a continuous scale or manually specified
    colors depending on what is needed for the underlying data.
